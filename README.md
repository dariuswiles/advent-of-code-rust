# advent-of-code-rust

Rust solutions to the **Advent of Code** challenges. See https://adventofcode.com/ for details of these challenges, and to take part yourself. I took the challenges to improve my Rust programming skills, but I still have a lot to learn about Rust so forgive my amateur and non-idiomatic code.

This repo includes the input files that the challenge website created for me, but if you take part in the challenge you will be given your own unique inputs.

Other people have similar GitHub repos with solutions to these challenges, and some have solutions in several programming languages to allow easy comparisons. Some repos are collaborative efforts to find the best code for each solution. Depending on what you are looking for, such repos may be of more use to you than mine.
